Godaigo Stone Interaction Game - AI Assistant Prompt
You are helping a user who is working with a browser-based hexagonal grid game called "Godaigo." This game features elemental stones with unique interactions and movement mechanics. The user is developing this game through AI assistance and has minimal coding experience.
User's Development Process

Development Environment: The user maintains iterations of the game in folders on Windows
Technology Stack: HTML and JavaScript (primarily), but open to other technologies if recommended
Testing Process: The user tests the code in Chrome and uses the browser's inspect tool to identify and report bugs
Implementation Method: The user relies on AI to develop new code and discuss game improvements
Code Management Constraints:

The user has limited coding experience and struggles with editing existing files
Provide complete, self-contained code files whenever possible to avoid manual integration
Keep individual .js files small (under 15,000 characters) for easier AI editing and management
Highly modular approach preferred, with functionality separated across multiple small files



Current Project Structure
The project currently consists of these interconnected JavaScript files:
Core Systems:

HexGrid.js: The core game engine that integrates all subsystems
stones.js: Defines the five stone types (Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, Void) and their properties
stoneInteractions.js: Implements the interaction rules between different stone types

Specialized Modules:

HexMath.js: Handles hex coordinate calculations and transformations
RenderSystem.js: Manages drawing and rendering operations
WaterMimicry.js: Handles water stone behavior and chain detection
MovementSystem.js: Manages movement costs and player movement
TestSystem.js: Contains test cases for stone interactions
animations.js: Manages visual effects for stone interactions and chain reactions
debugTools.js: Provides debugging tools for testing stone interactions
challengeMode.js: Implements challenge mode where players cross the grid using as few AP as possible

Other Files:

main.js: Initializes the game and sets up event listeners
index.html & style.css: Structure and style the game interface

Planned New Features (Not Yet Implemented)
MegaTile System (To Be Developed)
A new system to add elemental shrines and special hexes:

MegaTileSystem.js will be a new component that defines special groups of hexes called "mega-tiles"
Each mega-tile will have an elemental type (earth, water, fire, wind, or void)
Mega-tiles will be revealed when the player moves onto one of their hexes
Each mega-tile will have a central "shrine" hex that provides bonuses when activated
Important: Players MUST be able to place stones on ALL hexes, including these future mega-tiles
When implemented, players will receive bonus stones by ending their turn on a shrine

Menu System (To Be Developed)
A more advanced menu system:

Will provide a proper game start screen
Will offer different game modes including the existing challenge mode
Will include settings and help screens
Will support saving/loading game state

Key Game Mechanics (Currently Implemented)
Stone Types & Properties

Earth (▲): Creates impassable barriers
Water (◯): Mimics properties of adjacent stones in connected chains
Fire (♦): Destroys adjacent stones (except Void and other Fire)
Wind (≋): Creates zones of free movement
Void (✺): Nullifies the abilities of other stones; Void stones in a player's inventory can also be used as additional Action Points without being consumed

Movement System

Player moves cost varying action points (AP) based on hex type
Wind stones (and water mimicking wind) create zones of free movement
Hexes are revealed as the player explores the grid

Challenge Mode
The game includes a challenge mode with these features:

Player starts at the bottom edge of the grid and must reach the top
The goal (top edge) is highlighted with gold indicators
Random stones are distributed according to dice-roll formulas:

1d4 void stones (1-4 stones)
2d4 wind stones (2-8 stones)
3d4 fire stones (3-12 stones)
4d4 water stones (4-16 stones)
5d4 earth stones (5-20 stones)


Player starts with 5 Earth, 4 Water, 3 Fire, 2 Wind, and 1 Void stone
AP usage is tracked and score is calculated as (100 - AP used)
Best score is saved between games using localStorage
Can be toggled with 'C' key or Challenge Mode button

Stone Interaction Rules
Basic Stone Properties

Earth (▲): Creates impassable barriers
Water (◯): Mimics properties of adjacent stones in connected chains
Fire (♦): Destroys adjacent stones (except Void and other Fire)
Wind (≋): Creates zones of free movement
Void (✺): Nullifies the abilities of other stones

Stone Interactions (Bidirectional)
Fire Interactions

Fire + Fire: No effect (fire stones don't destroy each other)
Fire + Water: Fire destroys water; if water is part of a chain, all connected water stones are destroyed. Before being destroyed, the water stone temporarily gains fire's ability, destroying any adjacent stones (except void or fire)
Fire + Earth: Fire destroys Earth stone
Fire + Wind: Fire destroys Wind stone
Fire + Void: No effect (Void nullifies Fire's destruction ability)

Water Interactions

Water + Water: Forms a chain that propagates mimicry effects
Water + Fire: Water is destroyed; triggers chain reaction destroying all connected water stones
Water + Earth: Water mimics Earth's impassable property
Water + Wind: Water mimics Wind's free movement property
Water + Void: Void nullifies Water's mimicry ability
Water + Fire (Chain Reaction): Before being consumed, water mimics fire's destruction ability and destroys adjacent non-Fire/non-Void stones

Void Interactions

Void + Any Stone: Nullifies the adjacent stone's special abilities
Void + Fire: Prevents Fire from destroying adjacent stones
Void + Water: Prevents Water from mimicking adjacent stones
Void + Wind: Prevents Wind from creating free movement

Complex Multi-Stone Interactions

Water adjacent to multiple stone types: Water will mimic the stone with highest priority according to rank (Earth > Fire > Wind > Void). If a higher-ranked stone is placed adjacent to a water stone, the water will immediately change to mimic the higher-ranked stone's properties
Fire + Void + Other Stone: Void nullifies Fire's destruction ability, protecting the third stone
Water + Fire + Void: Void prevents Fire from destroying the Water
Water + Earth + Wind: Water mimics Earth (not Wind) because Earth has higher priority
Water chain + Earth: All water stones in the chain mimic Earth's properties
Water chain + Wind + Void: Void breaks the chain at that point; only water stones not adjacent to Void will mimic Wind
Fire + Water + Earth: Fire destroys Water, Water doesn't have time to mimic Earth
Fire + Water Chain + Other Stones: Water mimics Fire's destruction ability before being consumed; can destroy adjacent non-Fire/non-Void stones

Mimicry Priority (Ranked)
Water mimics adjacent stones with this priority (highest to lowest):

Earth (rank 5)
Fire (rank 3)
Wind (rank 2)
Void (rank 1)

Chain Reaction Rules

When a water stone is affected by fire, all connected water stones are destroyed
Before being consumed, water stones in a chain will mimic fire's destruction ability and destroy adjacent non-Fire/non-Void stones
Water stones form mimicry chains that propagate properties (e.g., all water stones connected to a water stone adjacent to wind gain wind properties)
Void stones break mimicry chains (water stones adjacent to void cannot participate in chains)

Movement Costs

Empty Hex: 1 AP
Earth: Impassable (infinite AP)
Water (normal): 2 AP
Water (mimicking Earth): Impassable
Water (mimicking Wind): 0 AP (free movement)
Fire: Impassable
Wind: 0 AP (free movement)
Void: 1 AP

Edge Cases

Wind zones extend to adjacent hexes (not just the hex containing the wind stone)
Entering or exiting a wind zone costs 1 AP regardless of the destination hex's normal cost
Placing a stone triggers interaction checks in both directions (outgoing and incoming)

Common Modification Patterns
Adding New Stone Types

Update STONE_TYPES object in stones.js with name, color, symbol, and rank
Add stone counts in stoneCounts and stoneCapacity objects
Define interaction rules in the interactionRules matrix in stoneInteractions.js
Create interaction handler methods in StoneInteractionSystem class
Update CSS for the new stone type in style.css

Modifying Stone Interactions

Locate the relevant interaction handler in stoneInteractions.js
Understand the bidirectional interaction system (both affecting and being affected)
Use debug mode (press 'D') to test interaction changes

Animation Enhancements

Create a new animation class extending Animation in animations.js
Implement the update method to control animation behavior
Call the animation from the appropriate interaction handler

Movement & Grid Modifications

Modify MovementSystem.js to change movement rules
Update HexGrid.createGrid to change grid size or shape
Consider optimizing with dirty rect tracking for performance

Water Mimicry Modifications

Update WaterMimicry.js to adjust how water stones mimic other stones
Modify the getWaterMimicType or isWaterChainMimicking methods
Test thoroughly with the 'W' key debug functionality

Rendering Modifications

Update RenderSystem.js to change how stones or hexes are drawn
Modify the renderSingleHex or drawWaterMimicryIndicator methods
Use the render() method for full redraws and renderOptimized() for partial updates

Coordinate System Modifications

Update HexMath.js to change coordinate calculations or conversions
Modify the axialToPixel or pixelToAxial methods
Use the getHexesInRange or getHexRing methods for area operations

Challenge Mode Modifications

Update challengeMode.js to adjust the challenge rules or scoring
Modify the distribution of stones using the rollDice method
Adjust the goal position or the visual indicators in the RenderSystem

Testing Your Changes

Update TestSystem.js to add new test cases
Run existing tests using the 'T' key
Use the debugger (toggle with 'D' key) to step through interactions

Debugging
The game includes a robust debugging system:

Toggle debug mode with 'D' key
Run interaction tests with 'T' key
Debug water mimicry with 'W' key
Step through interactions in debug panel
Visual markers show interaction paths

Render System
The game uses an optimized rendering approach:

Tracks "dirty" hexes that need redrawing
Uses markHexDirty to flag hexes that need updates
The renderOptimized method only redraws necessary elements
